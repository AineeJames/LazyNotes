## Description:
LazyNotes utilizes opencv, packer, and other tools to create note sheets
for you. By filling a directory called "slides" with images, boxed notes will
be transferred onto a blank A4 page.

## Usage:
- place images to be processed in a directory named "slides" in the same directory
  as main.py
- create an empty directory called "extracted"
- run main.py
